## Phonetic Flashcards  
This is a little python script I wrote for learning the phonetic alphabet. It's designed to just use repetition to drill it into the brain. It seems to be working for me, so long as I keep practising at it. I think I'd like to rewrite this in C++ too, it seems like a good way to keep practising arrays
